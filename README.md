# Carly's Clippers Project

## Part of 'Learn Python 3 - Codecademy Projects'

I am now doing some Data Analyst work for the small business Carlyâ€™s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. My job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. I then calculated some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.
